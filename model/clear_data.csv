The Recursive Book of Recursion,Al Sweigart,"An accessible yet rigorous crash course on recursive programming using Python and JavaScript examples. Recursion has an intimidating reputation: it’s considered to be an advanced computer science topic frequently brought up in coding interviews. But there’s nothing magical about recursion. The Recursive Book of Recursion uses Python and JavaScript examples to teach the basics of recursion, exposing the ways that it’s often poorly taught and clarifying the fundamental principles of all recursive algorithms. You’ll learn when to use recursive functions (and, most importantly, when not to use them), how to implement the classic recursive algorithms often brought up in job interviews, and how recursive techniques can help solve countless problems involving tree traversal, combinatorics, and other tricky topics. This project-based guide contains complete, runnable programs to help you learn: How recursive functions make use of the call stack, a critical data structure almost never discussed in lessons on recursion How the head-tail and “leap of faith” techniques can simplify writing recursive functions How to use recursion to write custom search scripts for your filesystem, draw fractal art, create mazes, and more How optimization and memoization make recursive algorithms more efficient Al Sweigart has built a career explaining programming concepts in a fun, approachable manner. If you’ve shied away from learning recursion but want to add this technique to your programming toolkit, or if you’re racing to prepare for your next job interview, this book is for you.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BRZOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

JavaScript Allongé,Reginald Braithwaite,"JavaScript Allongé solves two important problems for the ambitious JavaScript programmer. First, JavaScript Allongé gives you the tools to deal with JavaScript bugs, hitches, edge cases, and other potential pitfalls. There are plenty of good directions for how to write JavaScript programs. If you follow them without alteration or deviation, you will be satisfied. Unfortunately, software is a complex thing, full of interactions and side-effects. Two perfectly reasonable pieces of advice when taken separately may conflict with each other when taken together. An approach may seem sound at the outset of a project, but need to be revised when new requirements are discovered. When you “leave the path” of the directions, you discover their limitations. In order to solve the problems that occur at the edges, in order to adapt and deal with changes, in order to refactor and rewrite as needed, you need to understand the underlying principles of the JavaScript programming language in detail. You need to understand why the directions work so that you can understand how to modify them to work properly at or beyond their original limitations. That’s where JavaScript Allongé comes in. JavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions, because JavaScript is a programming language built on flexible and powerful functions. JavaScript Allongé begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. In each case, JavaScript Allongé takes care to explain exactly how things work so that when you encounter a problem, you’ll know exactly what is happening and how to fix it. Second, JavaScript Allongé provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric. JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript’s power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor, thus avoiding problems before they happen. JavaScript Allongé teaches you how to handle complex code, and it also teaches you how to simplify code without dumbing it down. As a result, JavaScript Allongé is a rich read releasing many of JavaScript’s subtleties, much like the Café Allongé beloved by coffee enthusiasts everywhere.

High Performance Web Sites,Steve Souders,"Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Each performance rule is supported by specific examples, and code snippets are available on the book's companion web site. The rules include how to: Make Fewer HTTP Requests Use a Content Delivery Network Add an Expires Header Gzip Components Put Stylesheets at the Top Put Scripts at the Bottom Avoid CSS Expressions Make JavaScript and CSS External Reduce DNS Lookups Minify JavaScript Avoid Redirects Remove Duplicates Scripts Configure ETags Make Ajax Cacheable If you're building pages for high traffic destinations and want to optimize the experience of users visiting your site, this book is indispensable. ""If everyone would implement just 20% of Steve's guidelines, the Web would be adramatically better place. Between this book and Steve's YSlow extension, there's reallyno excuse for having a sluggish web site anymore."" -Joe Hewitt, Developer of Firebug debugger and Mozilla's DOM Inspector ""Steve Souders has done a fantastic job of distilling a massive, semi-arcane art down to a set of concise, actionable, pragmatic engineering steps that will change the world of web performance."" -Eric Lawrence, Developer of the Fiddler Web Debugger, Microsoft Corporation",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jRVlgNDOr60C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Java,Andy Vickler,"Simplicity sets this book apart from all the others. This book contains proven strategies to learn Java programming in a short time. The market is replete with Java books, but the problem is that they are written in a complex and difficult to understand manner. In this book, you'll be able to easily understand each line of code with added explanations and comments for each code. Unlike many other authors, I have taken great care in producing the codes, ensuring they are all functional. However, you need to install the Eclipse compiler and configure it before practicing the codes. Coding is a fun and productive activity if you are not just reading it. I encourage you to take the code samples in the book, edit them per your choice, and run them in a compiler to see what output you can produce after the changes to the code. The more you do the edits, the better you will be at coding in Java Swing. This is one of the best languages to do front-end programming. You will enjoy it when you start producing the results of your choice. Are you interested in learning the ins and outs of backend development? Have you learned the basics of the Java computer programming language and want to take your learning further? Then you've picked up the right guide. Backend programming is not the easiest, nor is it the hardest part of developing a web application. However, it is an incredibly satisfying part. Backend development is all about making a web application work; it's the ins and outs of the server-side of the application, what the user sees, how they can interact with it, and much more.",
Modern Front-end Architecture,Ryan Lanciaux,"Learn how to build front-end applications that can help you ship applications faster with fewer defects. Many software projects fail because they are not planned well, or lack organization. Applying strategies from other industries can help you create better software. This book explores the “mise en place” technique from cooking and reveals how you can apply it to the art of creating software. In many professional kitchens, the work of preparing a meal is divided and performed in workstations to help create the whole. You'll review the philosophy behind this and see how to leverage this approach in your code. You'll also learn to visualize your applications as a series of components and build parts of your application in isolation - just like a professional chef crafting each part of the meal. The book describes to how to structure your code base for reuse, and how to communicate the code’s intent to other developers. You’ll develop your components in isolation and test these building blocks for quality at a granular level. Then compose these components as building blocks in increasingly complicated features. Finally, you’ll apply some strategies not directly related to code to ensure maximum quality and efficiency. With Modern Front-end Architecture, developers of all levels will learn strategies that they and their teams can leverage to be more productive. What You'll Learn Structure an application as a series of components Build a component library that others in an organization can leverage Ensure quality and accessibility at a component level rather than a page or app level Test code in a way that gives the maximum amount of confidence while providing an excellent developer experience Automate repeatable tasks Who This Book Is For Front end developers looking to maximize their code for reuse, quality, and shipping features quickly.

Many Web applications make use of a database to store data, and this book contains three chapters on working with MySQL databases. Once again, if you’re already familiar with databases in general — and MySQL in particular — you’ll be able to fly through these chapters. However, even if you’ve never touched a database before in your life, you should still be able to pick up a working knowledge by reading through these chapters.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1TcK2bIJlZIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Responsive Web Design with Adobe Photoshop,Dan Rose,"For a couple of decades now, designers have used Photoshop to mock up Web page designs. However, that work generally results in a static graphic of the page, which has to be translated by a developer into the components of a Web page: HTML files and Web-compatible image files. Our multi-device world has shown us that this approach to web design, including full-page comps done in Photoshop, is increasingly problematic. Modern web designers are adopting a new approach: creating flexible web pages whose layout can adapt to suit the screen on which they are displayed. This is “Responsive Web Design” [RWD]. Until now, books on designing responsive Web sites have focused on HTML and CSS – in other words, they've been very code-centric, and visual creativity seems to take a back seat. This new book is aimed at the visual Web designer who’s accustomed to working in Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop CC contains many new features that help streamline the process of converting a static page design to a set of components for a responsive web page. Dan Rose is one of the best-known advocates of this new way of working in Photoshop. He’s observed that only a few people are talking about Photoshop for RWD constructively, yet a majority (63% as of his last informal poll) of web designers are using Photoshop for more than simple asset creation. This transition is a pain point for many designers. His new book will balance coverage of conceptual issues (how to fit tools like Photoshop to the design workflow rather than fitting a workflow to the tools) with practical design exercises tailored to help communicate the overall design direction of the page while respecting the needs of the fluid Web. In addition, he will introduce methods for taking HTML back into Photoshop for further refinement.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xeMnBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Flexible Web Design,Zoe Mickley Gillenwater,"Liquid or fluid layouts change width based on the user's unique device viewing size. These types of layouts have always been possible with tables but offer new design challenges as well as opportunities when built with CSS. This book, for experienced Web designers with some CSS experience, outlines how to do this successfully. Designers will learn the benefits of flexible layouts and when to choose a liquid, elastic, or hybrid design. They will learn not only how to build a liquid layout from scratch using standards-compliant and cross-browser compatible (X)HTML and CSS, but will also learn how to design and slice their graphic comps in a way that makes flexible design achievable. This book will show designers that flexible layouts do not have to be visually boring or difficult to build when planned and built correctly. Even those who do not intend to build liquid layouts can use the concepts and techniques taught in this book to improve their fixed-width CSS designs, because they will learn how to design for the inherent flexibility of the web medium, instead of the rigid qualities of print media or table grid-based layouts.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wbymk9cteGMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

SQL and Relational Theory,C. Date,"SQL is full of difficulties and traps for the unwary. You can avoid them if you understand relational theory, but only if you know how to put the theory into practice. In this insightful book, author C.J. Date explains relational theory in depth, and demonstrates through numerous examples and exercises how you can apply it directly to your use of SQL. This second edition includes new material on recursive queries, “missing information” without nulls, new update operators, and topics such as aggregate operators, grouping and ungrouping, and view updating. If you have a modest-to-advanced background in SQL, you’ll learn how to deal with a host of common SQL dilemmas. Why is proper column naming so important? Nulls in your database are causing you to get wrong answers. Why? What can you do about it? Is it possible to write an SQL query to find employees who have never been in the same department for more than six months at a time? SQL supports “quantified comparisons,” but they’re better avoided. Why? How do you avoid them? Constraints are crucially important, but most SQL products don’t support them properly. What can you do to resolve this situation? Database theory and practice have evolved since the relational model was developed more than 40 years ago. SQL and Relational Theory draws on decades of research to present the most up-to-date treatment of SQL available. C.J. Date has a stature that is unique within the database industry. A prolific writer well known for the bestselling textbook An Introduction to Database Systems (Addison-Wesley), he has an exceptionally clear style when writing about complex principles and theory.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ew06OZtjuJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Executive's How-To Guide to Automation,George E. Danner,"From driverless cars to pilotless planes, many functions that have previously required human labor can now be performed using artificial intelligence. For businesses, this use of AI results in reduced labor costs and, even more important, creating a competitive advantage. How does one look at any organization and begin the work of automating it in sensible ways? This book provides the blueprint for automating critical business functions of all kinds. It outlines the skills and technologies that must be brought to bear on replicating human-like thinking and judgment in the form of algorithms. Many believe that algorithm design is the exclusive purview of computer scientists and experienced programmers. This book aims to dispel that notion. An algorithm is merely a set of rules, and anyone with the ability to envision how different components of a business can interact with other components already has the ability to work in algorithms. Though many fear that the use of automation in business means human labor will no longer be needed, the author argues that organizations will re-purpose humans into different roles under the banner of automation, not simply get rid of them. He also identifies parts of business that are best targeted for automation. This book will arm business people with the tools needed to automate companies, making them perform better, move faster, operate cheaper, and provide great lasting value to investors.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CnWADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
A Human Algorithm,Flynn Coleman,"A groundbreaking narrative on the urgency of ethically designed AI and a guidebook to reimagining life in the era of intelligent technology. The Age of Intelligent Machines is upon us, and we are at a reflection point. The proliferation of fast–moving technologies, including forms of artificial intelligence akin to a new species, will cause us to confront profound questions about ourselves. The era of human intellectual superiority is ending, and we need to plan for this monumental shift. A Human Algorithm: How Artificial Intelligence Is Redefining Who We Are examines the immense impact intelligent technology will have on humanity. These machines, while challenging our personal beliefs and our socioeconomic world order, also have the potential to transform our health and well–being, alleviate poverty and suffering, and reveal the mysteries of intelligence and consciousness. International human rights attorney Flynn Coleman deftly argues that it is critical that we instill values, ethics, and morals into our robots, algorithms, and other forms of AI. Equally important, we need to develop and implement laws, policies, and oversight mechanisms to protect us from tech’s insidious threats. To realize AI’s transcendent potential, Coleman advocates for inviting a diverse group of voices to participate in designing our intelligent machines and using our moral imagination to ensure that human rights, empathy, and equity are core principles of emerging technologies. Ultimately, A Human Algorithm is a clarion call for building a more humane future and moving conscientiously into a new frontier of our own design. “[Coleman] argues that the algorithms of machine learning––if they are instilled with human ethics and values––could bring about a new era of enlightenment.” —San Francisco Chronicle",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R-EREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning,Csaba Szepesvari,"Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective. What distinguishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book, we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qwtphfl7U74C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Machine Learning and AI in Finance,"German Creamer, Gary Kazantsev, Tomaso Aste","The significant amount of information available in any field requires a systematic and analytical approach to select the most critical information and anticipate major events. During the last decade, the world has witnessed a rapid expansion of applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to an increasingly broad range of financial markets and problems. Machine learning and AI algorithms facilitate this process understanding, modelling and forecasting the behaviour of the most relevant financial variables. The main contribution of this book is the presentation of new theoretical and applied AI perspectives to find solutions to unsolved finance questions. This volume proposes an optimal model for the volatility smile, for modelling high-frequency liquidity demand and supply and for the simulation of market microstructure features. Other new AI developments explored in this book includes building a universal model for a large number of stocks, developing predictive models based on the average price of the crowd, forecasting the stock price using the attention mechanism in a neural network, clustering multivariate time series into different market states, proposing a multivariate distance nonlinear causality test and filtering out false investment strategies with an unsupervised learning algorithm. Machine Learning and AI in Finance explores the most recent advances in the application of innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence models to predict financial time series, to simulate the structure of the financial markets, to explore nonlinear causality models, to test investment strategies and to price financial options.

Your Boss Is an Algorithm,"Antonio Aloisi, Valerio De Stefano","What effect do robots, algorithms, and online platforms have on the world of work? Using case studies and examples from across the EU, the UK, and the US, this book provides a compass to navigate this technological transformation as well as the regulatory options available, and proposes a new map for the era of radical digital advancements. From platform work to the gig-economy and the impact of artificial intelligence, algorithmic management, and digital surveillance on workplaces, technology has overwhelming consequences for everyone's lives, reshaping the labour market and straining social institutions. Contrary to preliminary analyses forecasting the threat of human work obsolescence, the book demonstrates that digital tools are more likely to replace managerial roles and intensify organisational processes in workplaces, rather than opening the way for mass job displacement. Can flexibility and protection be reconciled so that legal frameworks uphold innovation? How can we address the pervasive power of AI-enabled monitoring? How likely is it that the gig-economy model will emerge as a new organisational paradigm across sectors? And what can social partners and political players do to adopt effective regulation? Technology is never neutral. It can and must be governed, to ensure that progress favours the many. Digital transformation can be an essential ally, from the warehouse to the office, but it must be tested in terms of social and political sustainability, not only through the lenses of economic convenience. Your Boss Is an Algorithm offers a guide to explore these new scenarios, their promises, and perils.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JGB7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence,Kartik Hosanagar,"A Wharton professor and tech entrepreneur examines how algorithms and artificial intelligence are starting to run every aspect of our lives, and how we can shape the way they impact us Through the technology embedded in almost every major tech platform and every web-enabled device, algorithms and the artificial intelligence that underlies them make a staggering number of everyday decisions for us, from what products we buy, to where we decide to eat, to how we consume our news, to whom we date, and how we find a job. We've even delegated life-and-death decisions to algorithms--decisions once made by doctors, pilots, and judges. In his new book, Kartik Hosanagar surveys the brave new world of algorithmic decision-making and reveals the potentially dangerous biases they can give rise to as they increasingly run our lives. He makes the compelling case that we need to arm ourselves with a better, deeper, more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of algorithmic thinking. And he gives us a route in, pointing out that algorithms often think a lot like their creators--that is, like you and me. Hosanagar draws on his experiences designing algorithms professionally--as well as on history, computer science, and psychology--to explore how algorithms work and why they occasionally go rogue, what drives our trust in them, and the many ramifications of algorithmic decision-making. He examines episodes like Microsoft's chatbot Tay, which was designed to converse on social media like a teenage girl, but instead turned sexist and racist; the fatal accidents of self-driving cars; and even our own common, and often frustrating, experiences on services like Netflix and Amazon. A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence is an entertaining and provocative look at one of the most important developments of our time and a practical user's guide to this first wave of practical artificial intelligence.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YrbPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Algorithms Are Not Enough,Herbert L. Roitblat,"Why a new approach is needed in the quest for general artificial intelligence. Since the inception of artificial intelligence, we have been warned about the imminent arrival of computational systems that can replicate human thought processes. Before we know it, computers will become so intelligent that humans will be lucky to kept as pets. And yet, although artificial intelligence has become increasingly sophisticated—with such achievements as driverless cars and humanless chess-playing—computer science has not yet created general artificial intelligence. In Algorithms Are Not Enough, Herbert Roitblat explains how artificial general intelligence may be possible and why a robopocalypse is neither imminent, nor likely. Existing artificial intelligence, Roitblat shows, has been limited to solving path problems, in which the entire problem consists of navigating a path of choices—finding specific solutions to well-structured problems. Human problem-solving, on the other hand, includes problems that consist of ill-structured situations, including the design of problem-solving paths themselves. These are insight problems, and insight is an essential part of intelligence that has not been addressed by computer science. Roitblat draws on cognitive science, including psychology, philosophy, and history, to identify the essential features of intelligence needed to achieve general artificial intelligence. Roitblat describes current computational approaches to intelligence, including the Turing Test, machine learning, and neural networks. He identifies building blocks of natural intelligence, including perception, analogy, ambiguity, common sense, and creativity. General intelligence can create new representations to solve new problems, but current computational intelligence cannot. The human brain, like the computer, uses algorithms; but general intelligence, he argues, is more than algorithmic processes.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DXaMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Beyond Algorithms,"James Luke, David Porter, Padmanabhan Santhanam","With so much artificial intelligence (AI) in the headlines, it is no surprise that businesses are scrambling to exploit this exciting and transformative technology. Clearly, those who are the first to deliver business-relevant AI will gain significant advantage. However, there is a problem! Our perception of AI success in society is primarily based on our experiences with consumer applications from the big web companies. The adoption of AI in the enterprise has been slow due to various challenges. Business applications address far more complex problems and the data needed to address them is less plentiful. There is also the critical need for alignment of AI with relevant business processes. In addition, the use of AI requires new engineering practices for application maintenance and trust. So, how do you deliver working AI applications in the enterprise? Beyond Algorithms: Delivering AI for Business answers this question. Written by three engineers with decades of experience in AI (and all the scars that come with that), this book explains what it takes to define, manage, engineer, and deliver end-to-end AI applications that work.

In AI We Trust,Helga Nowotny,"One of the most persistent concerns about the future is whether it will be dominated by the predictive algorithms of AI – and, if so, what this will mean for our behaviour, for our institutions and for what it means to be human. AI changes our experience of time and the future and challenges our identities, yet we are blinded by its efficiency and fail to understand how it affects us. At the heart of our trust in AI lies a paradox: we leverage AI to increase our control over the future and uncertainty, while at the same time the performativity of AI, the power it has to make us act in the ways it predicts, reduces our agency over the future. This happens when we forget that that we humans have created the digital technologies to which we attribute agency. These developments also challenge the narrative of progress, which played such a central role in modernity and is based on the hubris of total control. We are now moving into an era where this control is limited as AI monitors our actions, posing the threat of surveillance, but also offering the opportunity to reappropriate control and transform it into care. As we try to adjust to a world in which algorithms, robots and avatars play an ever-increasing role, we need to understand better the limitations of AI and how their predictions affect our agency, while at the same time having the courage to embrace the uncertainty of the future.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ENM-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The increase in demand for automation has generated many applications for AI in fields such as robotics, predictive analytics, finance, and more. In this book, you will understand what artificial intelligence is. It explains in detail basic search methods: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search, which can be used to make intelligent decisions when the initial state, end state, and possible actions are known. Random solutions or greedy solutions can be found for such problems. But these are not optimal in either space or time and efficient approaches in time and space will be explored. We will also understand how to formulate a problem, which involves looking at it and identifying its initial state, goal state, and the actions that are possible in each state. We also need to understand the data structures involved while implementing these search algorithms as they form the basis of search exploration. Finally, we will look into what a heuristic is as this decides the quality of one sub-solution over another and helps you decide which step to take. What you will learn Understand the instances where searches can be used Understand the algorithms that can be used to make decisions more intelligent Formulate a problem by specifying its initial state, goal state, and actions Translate the concepts of the selected search algorithm into code Compare how basic search algorithms will perform for the application Implement algorithmic programming using code examples Who this book is for This book is for developers who are keen to get started with Artificial Intelligence and develop practical AI-based applications.

Responsible AI,"Sray Agarwal, Shashin Mishra","This book is written for software product teams that use AI to add intelligent models to their products or are planning to use it. As AI adoption grows, it is becoming important that all AI driven products can demonstrate they are not introducing any bias to the AI-based decisions they are making, as well as reducing any pre-existing bias or discrimination. The responsibility to ensure that the AI models are ethical and make responsible decisions does not lie with the data scientists alone. The product owners and the business analysts are as important in ensuring bias-free AI as the data scientists on the team. This book addresses the part that these roles play in building a fair, explainable and accountable model, along with ensuring model and data privacy. Each chapter covers the fundamentals for the topic and then goes deep into the subject matter - providing the details that enable the business analysts and the data scientists to implement these fundamentals.

Democratic Frontiers,Michael Filimowicz,"Democratic Frontiers: Algorithms and Society focuses on digital platforms’ effects in societies with respect to key areas such as subjectivity and self-reflection, data and measurement for the common good, public health and accessible datasets, activism in social media and the import/export of AI technologies relative to regime type. Digital technologies develop at a much faster pace relative to our systems of governance which are supposed to embody democratic principles that are comparatively timeless, whether rooted in ancient Greek or Enlightenment ideas of freedom, autonomy and citizenship. Algorithms, computing millions of calculations per second, do not pause to reflect on their operations. Developments in the accumulation of vast private datasets that are used to train automated machine learning algorithms pose new challenges for upholding these values. Social media platforms, while the key driver of today’s information disorder, also afford new opportunities for organized social activism. The US and China, presumably at opposite ends of an ideological spectrum, are the main exporters of AI technology to both free and totalitarian societies. These are some of the important topics covered by this volume that examines the democratic stakes for societies with the rapid expansion of these technologies. Scholars and students from many backgrounds as well as policy makers, journalists and the general reading public will find a multidisciplinary approach to issues of democratic values and governance encompassing research from Sociology, Digital Humanities, New Media, Psychology, Communication, International Relations and Economics.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6J9cEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Big Data Revolution,"Jason Kolb, Jeremy Kolb","We create more data in a day then we did from the dawn of man through 2003 and approximately 90% of all the world's data has been created in the past 2 years. What does this mean to you? In The Big Data Revolution we explore this very question and reveal the data secrets your competitors don't want you to know. Our world is transforming as the data deluge knocks us out of our old ways and into the data driven reality. Some companies are winning by taking advantages of the opportunities in this evolving world while others are falling behind. Pioneers like Amazon, Target, and Google are blazing a trail that we can follow, and in The Big Data Revolution we help you do just that. Big Data promises to give us a world driven by information and solid data, bringing far greater productivity, increased profits, and lower costs; and in The Big Data Revolution we explore those winning strategies and techniques and the tools behind them. Want to learn how companies like Amazon, Target, and IBM use data to gain competitive advantages? Or how Obama used Big Data tools to better utilize his resources? The Big Data Revolution was written for the non-or-only-slightly-technical business person in mind--but in a way that gives you enough meat behind the ideas so that you have a road map that tells you how to get where you want to go. It uses real-world examples and case studies to illustrates the concepts and explore the technology that makes them happen. The Big Data Revolution is comprised of four parts: Part 1: Data Science In Part 1 we first introduce you to the world of data science and analytics. These are the tools companies and governments use to refine their crude data into valuable insights. In this section, we'll look at the magic behind Amazon's success, and see how data is leading towards a near Minority Report future. Part 2: Big Data Data is growing at an exceptional rate, we produce more data now in a day than we did from the dawn of man till 2003. This explosion of data creates many unique struggles as well as opportunities. In this section we'll look at how Obama invested in Big Data during his presidential campaign, and explore how startups are revealing data that saves their clients substantial capital. Part 3: Tools of the trade Data Scientists cannot just look at big data and get value from it, it doesn't matter how good they are. The data is just too big. So companies like IBM and Microsoft build tools that help people make sense of data, and hopefully discover new useful insights from it. The two primary categories of tools you need to be aware of are Business Intelligence and Data Discovery. In this section we explore these broad terms, and show how companies are designing more specialized tools for specific purposes. Part 4: Gazing into the Future In order to position yourself well for what is to come you need to know where we are now and almost more importantly where we are going to be in the near future. In this section we explore the trends that are going to matter as we move forward in this emerging technology industry. Computerized Data Analytics is truly still in its early stages of development, and things are going to change as new innovations come to the forefront.

The Rise of Big Spatial Data,"Igor Ivan, Alex Singleton, Jiří Horák, Tomáš Inspektor","This edited volume gathers the proceedings of the Symposium GIS Ostrava 2016, the Rise of Big Spatial Data, held at the Technical University of Ostrava, Czech Republic, March 16–18, 2016. Combining theoretical papers and applications by authors from around the globe, it summarises the latest research findings in the area of big spatial data and key problems related to its utilisation. Welcome to dawn of the big data era: though it’s in sight, it isn’t quite here yet. Big spatial data is characterised by three main features: volume beyond the limit of usual geo-processing, velocity higher than that available using conventional processes, and variety, combining more diverse geodata sources than usual. The popular term denotes a situation in which one or more of these key properties reaches a point at which traditional methods for geodata collection, storage, processing, control, analysis, modelling, validation and visualisation fail to provide effective solutions. >Entering the era of big spatial data calls for finding solutions that address all “small data” issues that soon create “big data” troubles. Resilience for big spatial data means solving the heterogeneity of spatial data sources (in topics, purpose, completeness, guarantee, licensing, coverage etc.), large volumes (from gigabytes to terabytes and more), undue complexity of geo-applications and systems (i.e. combination of standalone applications with web services, mobile platforms and sensor networks), neglected automation of geodata preparation (i.e. harmonisation, fusion), insufficient control of geodata collection and distribution processes (i.e. scarcity and poor quality of metadata and metadata systems), limited analytical tool capacity (i.e. domination of traditional causal-driven analysis), low visual system performance, inefficient knowledge-discovery techniques (for transformation of vast amounts of information into tiny and essential outputs) and much more.

The unique way to rigorously structure Ring programs is also explained. Then, in the second part you’ll discover Ring inputs, outputs, and what is in between. You’ll use the basic constructs of computer logic (sequence, selection, and iteration) to build simple and complex logic flows. You’ll go over the common mistakes that lead to code complexity, by example, and cover several strategies to solve them (refactoring, code cleansing, and good variable naming). Then, you’ll see a visual illustration of how Ring deals with scopes at the local, object, and global levels. In part three, you’ll play with two artifacts vital to Ring programming: functions and objects. You’ll learn how they can be composed to solve a problem and how advanced programming paradigms, such as declarative and natural, are beautifully implemented on top of them. As part of the discussion, you’ll also work on game programming. You’ll learn how you design your game declaratively, in Ring code, just as if you were designing it in visual software. Finally, the author lays out how programming can be understood in a gamified context. You will be told the truth about how gaming can be a better metaphor to achieve mastery of Ring programming.

Deep Learning,"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville","An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. “Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.” —Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Neural Networks and Deep Learning,Charu C. Aggarwal,"This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines.

Programming Machine Learning,Paolo Perrotta,"You've decided to tackle machine learning - because you're job hunting, embarking on a new project, or just think self-driving cars are cool. But where to start? It's easy to be intimidated, even as a software developer. The good news is that it doesn't have to be that hard. Master machine learning by writing code one line at a time, from simple learning programs all the way to a true deep learning system. Tackle the hard topics by breaking them down so they're easier to understand, and build your confidence by getting your hands dirty. Peel away the obscurities of machine learning, starting from scratch and going all the way to deep learning. Machine learning can be intimidating, with its reliance on math and algorithms that most programmers don't encounter in their regular work. Take a hands-on approach, writing the Python code yourself, without any libraries to obscure what's really going on. Iterate on your design, and add layers of complexity as you go. Build an image recognition application from scratch with supervised learning. Predict the future with linear regression. Dive into gradient descent, a fundamental algorithm that drives most of machine learning. Create perceptrons to classify data. Build neural networks to tackle more complex and sophisticated data sets. Train and refine those networks with backpropagation and batching. Layer the neural networks, eliminate overfitting, and add convolution to transform your neural network into a true deep learning system. Start from the beginning and code your way to machine learning mastery. What You Need: The examples in this book are written in Python, but don't worry if you don't know this language: you'll pick up all the Python you need very quickly.

The Deep Learning Revolution,Terrence J. Sejnowski,"How deep learning—from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive assistants—is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy. The deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy. Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades.

Machine and deep learning methods are often used in contemporary data science tasks to address the growing data sets and detect, cluster, and classify data patterns. Although machine learning commercial interest has grown relatively recently, the roots of machine learning go back to decades ago. We note that nearly all organizations, including industry, government, defense, and health, are using machine learning to address a variety of needs and applications. The machine learning paradigms presented can be broadly divided into the following three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms focus on learning a mapping function, and they are trained with supervision on labeled data. Supervised learning is further sub-divided into classification and regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning typically does not have access to ground truth, and often the goal is to learn or uncover the hidden pattern in the data. Through semi-supervised learning, one can effectively utilize a large volume of unlabeled data and a limited amount of labeled data to improve machine learning model performances. Deep learning and neural networks are also covered in this book. Deep neural networks have attracted a lot of interest during the last ten years due to the availability of graphics processing units (GPU) computational power, big data, and new software platforms. They have strong capabilities in terms of learning complex mapping functions for different types of data. We organize the book as follows. The book starts by introducing concepts in supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. Several algorithms and their inner workings are presented within these three categories. We then continue with a brief introduction to artificial neural network algorithms and their properties. In addition, we cover an array of applications and provide extensive bibliography. The book ends with a summary of the key machine learning concepts.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZYFyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Mathematics for Machine Learning,"Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong","The fundamental mathematical tools needed to understand machine learning include linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decompositions, vector calculus, optimization, probability and statistics.

Data Science and Data Analytics,Amit Kumar Tyagi,"Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured (labeled) and unstructured (unlabeled) data. It is the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a necessity of the future to make things easier and more productive. In simple terms, data science is the discovery of data or uncovering hidden patterns (such as complex behaviors, trends, and inferences) from data. Moreover, Big Data analytics/data analytics are the analysis mechanisms used in data science by data scientists. Several tools, such as Hadoop, R, etc., are used to analyze this large amount of data to predict valuable information and for decision-making. Note that structured data can be easily analyzed by efficient (available) business intelligence tools, while most of the data (80% of data by 2020) is in an unstructured form that requires advanced analytics tools. But while analyzing this data, we face several concerns, such as complexity, scalability, privacy leaks, and trust issues. Data science helps us to extract meaningful information or insights from unstructured or complex or large amounts of data (available or stored virtually in the cloud).

On the Epistemology of Data Science,Wolfgang Pietsch,"This book addresses controversies concerning the epistemological foundations of data science: Is it a genuine science? Or is data science merely some inferior practice that can at best contribute to the scientific enterprise, but cannot stand on its own? The author proposes a coherent conceptual framework with which these questions can be rigorously addressed. Readers will discover a defense of inductivism and consideration of the arguments against it: an epistemology of data science more or less by definition has to be inductivist, given that data science starts with the data. As an alternative to enumerative approaches, the author endorses Federica Russo’s recent call for a variational rationale in inductive methodology. Chapters then address some of the key concepts of an inductivist methodology including causation, probability and analogy, before outlining an inductivist framework. The inductivist framework is shown to be adequate and useful for an analysis of the epistemological foundations of data science. The author points out that many aspects of the variational rationale are present in algorithms commonly used in data science. Introductions to algorithms and brief case studies of successful data science such as machine translation are included. Data science is located with reference to several crucial distinctions regarding different kinds of scientific practices, including between exploratory and theory-driven experimentation, and between phenomenological and theoretical science. Computer scientists, philosophers and data scientists of various disciplines will find this philosophical perspective and conceptual framework of great interest, especially as a starting point for further in-depth analysis of algorithms used in data science.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jEpUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
